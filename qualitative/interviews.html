                        <h3><b>Introduction:</b> A diary study is a research method that is used to collect data on usage behaviors, activities, and experiences over a long period of time. Typically, the user will self-report their activities at regular intervals
                            and create a log. Diary studies are best used for </h3>
                        <h3><b>Task:</b> I was tasked with performing two interviews with participants in the NJIT general area. I interviewed my Teachers Assistant for one of my classes and also an on-campus friend. The interviews were to be maximum 30 minutes
                            long, and to be transcribed for review. I was also a part of the data analysis.</h3>
                        <h3><b>Role:</b> My role was as an interviewer and also the researcher that transcribed and analyzed the 20 total interviews for insights. </h3>
                        <h3><b>Data:</b> My role was as the diary study participant and also as the researcher analyzing and reporting the data and any insights. </h3>
                        <h3><b>Results:</b> My role was as the diary study participant and also as the researcher analyzing and reporting the data and any insights. </h3>
                        <h3><b>Conclusions:</b> My role was as the diary study participant and also as the researcher analyzing and reporting the data and any insights. </h3>
                        <h3><b>Learnings:</b> Through the role that I played during these interviews I learned how this qualitative method can be used to explore individuals' general attitudes towards emojis and their purpose behind using them. This method
                            allowed me to gain general insight on the what people think about emojis, how they use, why they use them, when they use them, etc. Overall I learned what valuable information a researcher can gain from interviewing users and
                            in what cases they may not succeed. </h3>
