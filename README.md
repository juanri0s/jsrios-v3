The third version of my personal website

## Design

I really wanted to focus on content with this iteration of my website. This meant keeping the overall design simple and understandable. Because I am focusing my skills on user experience research, I wanted to put more case study friendly content on my site instead of a resume style personal site. 

The overall design was adopted after taking a look at some of the best UX portfolio sites, specifically, http://simonpan.com/. The site was built mainly with HTML and CSS and a tiny bit of javascript for the page load animation. I hope to stick with this design for a while because it really allows me to focus on quick changes and quick additions without worrying about how the site will look. 

## SEO

Something I really focused on was getting my website to be more optimized for people who search for me. Although I have a common name, when I paired my name with extra information like 'juan rios njit' or 'juan rios ups', my website was on the first page of google search results. A website that really helped me accomplish this was https://varvy.com/. This allowed me to check what was wrong with my site in terms of speed, user experience, loading times, seo, etc. I passed a good 95% of all the cases that the site checks for with the other 5% being out of my control. I hope to continue increasing my online presence and this website redesign really helped me learn more about accomplishing this.
