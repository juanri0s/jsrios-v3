The third version of my personal website

## Design

I really wanted to focus on content with this iteration of my website. This meant keeping the overall design simple and understandable. Because I am focusing my skills on user experience research, I wanted to put more case study friendly content on my site instead of a resume style personal site. 

The overall design was adopted after taking a look at some of the best UX portfolio sites, specifically, http://simonpan.com/. The site was built mainly with HTML and CSS and a tiny bit of javascript for the page load animation. I hope to stick with this design for a while because it really allows me to focus on quick changes and quick additions without worrying about how the site will look.
